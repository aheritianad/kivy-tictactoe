# **Directory of sample JSON files containing policies**

The directory contains 5 files:

## *Random policy* (`easy.json`)

It is a policy where all allowed action share the same probability for each state.

## `Softmax`, *medium level policies* (`medium_player{}.json`)

They are policies generated by applying `softmax` on the approximated `Q-function`. Apparently, they are close to be uniform except for few states (at least in my end).

## `Argmax`, *hard level policies* (`hard_player{}.json`)

They are policies generated by applying `argmax` on the approximated `Q-function`. If there are more than one maximu, then it will give a uniform distribution on `indices` of `maximum`.

## *Expert level policies* (`expert_player{}.json`)

These are policies generated from updated qfunction during some game against human player.
